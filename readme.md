The **AutoAFKReply** plugin for BetterDiscord automatically responds to direct messages when you're AFK. You can manually toggle AFK mode or set it to activate automatically after 5 minutes of inactivity. Fully customizable, this plugin ensures that your friends or colleagues are notified when you're away.

## Features
- **Manual AFK Mode**: Easily toggle AFK mode on or off via the plugin settings.
- **Auto AFK Mode**: Automatically enable AFK mode after 5 minutes of inactivity (customizable).
- **Customizable AFK Message**: Set your own AFK message to notify users when you're unavailable.
- **No Auto-Replies for Old Messages**: Only replies to new messages after AFK mode is activated.
- **Seamless Discord Integration**: Works smoothly with Discord, auto-replying only to DMs.
